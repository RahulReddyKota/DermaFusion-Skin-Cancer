# DermaFusion

Multi-source deep learning for **8-class skin-lesion classification** (MEL, NV, BCC, AKIEC, BKL, DF, VASC, OTHER), trained on four public dermatology datasets and shipped as both a Gradio research demo and a native iOS app.

- 🧠 **This repo** — the ML side: training pipeline, Colab notebook, Gradio inference runtime, CoreML export, and the deployment artifacts that feed the iOS app.
- 📱 **iOS app** — [`ManikantaSirumalla/DermaFusion-App`](https://github.com/ManikantaSirumalla/DermaFusion-App) (SwiftUI + Core ML, fully on-device inference).
- ⚖️ **Legal pages** — [`ManikantaSirumalla/DermaFusion-Legal`](https://github.com/ManikantaSirumalla/DermaFusion-Legal).

> [!WARNING]
> **Research use only — not a medical device.** DermaFusion is an academic research project. It is not FDA/CE cleared, has not been clinically validated, and must not be used to diagnose, screen, or make decisions about any real skin condition. Concerning skin lesions should always be evaluated by a qualified clinician.

## Headline results

Final **E0 + E3 soft-vote ensemble** (EfficientNet-B4 × 2, 380 × 380), evaluated on the held-out **TEST** set (*n* = 5,279) with 1,000-iteration bootstrap 95% confidence intervals.

| Metric | Value (95% CI) |
| --- | --- |
| 8-class balanced accuracy | **0.540** [0.509, 0.568] |
| 8-class macro F1 | **0.469** [0.441, 0.495] |
| Top-1 / Top-2 / Top-3 accuracy | 0.778 / 0.907 / 0.954 |
| Binary-malignant AUROC | 0.830 |
| Sensitivity @ 95% specificity | 0.462 |

The full per-class breakdown and the ISIC 2019 leaderboard comparison live in [`presentation/slides.md`](presentation/slides.md) and the notebook (Phases 15 + 20).

> **Reading the headline number.** 0.540 balanced accuracy is across **8 unified classes spanning four datasets** (dermoscopic *and* smartphone images), which is a harder setting than a single-dataset 8-class benchmark. Top-2 accuracy of 0.907 and a binary-malignant AUROC of 0.830 are the more clinically meaningful framing of the same model.
> <!-- TODO: drop in the specific ISIC 2019 leaderboard figure you cite in slides.md so readers can calibrate without leaving the page. -->

## Architecture

| Stage | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Data** | ISIC 2018 / 2019 / 2020 + PAD-UFES-20 → **61,694** dermoscopic + smartphone images, 8 unified classes |
| **Splits** | Patient-grouped (`GroupShuffleSplit` on `patient_id` → `lesion_id`) with iterative leakage enforcement → **TRAIN 52,483 / VAL 3,932 / TEST 5,279**, zero patient/lesion overlap |
| **Preprocessing** | Shades-of-Gray colour constancy (power = 6) + DullRazor hair removal + resize to 380 × 380 (cached as a 2.1 GB tarball on Drive) |
| **Backbone** | EfficientNet-B4 (~17.6 M params) — two members trained from different starting points |
| **E0** | `efficientnet_b4`; CB-Focal (γ = 1.5) + MixUp + TrivialAugmentWide + EMA 0.999; √-inverse sampler |
| **E3** | `tf_efficientnet_b4.ns_jft_in1k`; class-balanced focal (γ = 2.0); full-inverse sampler |
| **Ensemble** | Soft-vote with Dirichlet-optimised weights `[0.705, 0.295]`; per-class thresholds tuned on VAL macro-F1 |
| **Deployment** | Gradio (single 142 MB `dermafusion_ensemble.pt`) + iOS (two FP16 `.mlpackage` files, 34 MB each) |

---

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManikantaSirumalla/DermaFusion.git
cd DermaFusion
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requires **Python 3.10+** and **PyTorch 2.1+** (CUDA optional, for training). On Apple Silicon, make sure `coremltools`, `rpds-py`, and `pydantic-core` are installed as native **arm64** wheels — force-reinstall them if you previously pulled x86_64 wheels under Rosetta.

---

## Deployment artifacts

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The trained weights are not in this repo.** GitHub rejects files > 100 MB, so the checkpoints, the ensemble bundle, and the CoreML packages live elsewhere. **You cannot run inference from a fresh clone alone** — you must first obtain these binaries and place them at an auto-discovered path. A public GitHub Release with these artifacts is *not yet published*; until then, the only way to get them is to train them yourself (below).

| Artifact | Size | Where the runtime looks for it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dermafusion_ensemble.pt` (Gradio) | ~142 MB | `app/deployment_Bundle/dermafusion_ensemble.pt` (preferred), or set `DERMAFUSION_BUNDLE=...` |
| `E0.pt` / `E3.pt` (per-member ckpts) | ~71 MB each | `app/deployment_Bundle/` (only needed to regenerate CoreML packages) |
| `E0.mlpackage` / `E3.mlpackage` | ~34 MB each | `app/deployment_Bundle/` (consumed by the iOS app via the companion repo) |

**Two ways to get them:**

1. **Train them yourself** in Colab via [`notebooks/DermaFusion_Personal_Final.ipynb`](notebooks/DermaFusion_Personal_Final.ipynb) (Phases 1–14). The notebook auto-archives `dermafusion_ensemble.pt` to Google Drive.
2. **Download a GitHub Release** of this repo (once one is published).

Regenerate the CoreML packages from `E0.pt` + `E3.pt` + `dermafusion_ensemble.pt`:

```bash
cd app/deployment_Bundle
python export_coreml.py
# → produces E0.mlpackage, E3.mlpackage, ensemble_config.json
```

---

## Run the Gradio demo

```bash
python -m demo.app
```

The runtime auto-discovers the bundle. On the first request it cold-loads `DermaFusionEnsemble` (the pickled `nn.Module` shipped inside the `.pt`); subsequent predictions reuse the warm model. The UI shows top-K probabilities, a GradCAM overlay, and the MEL triage decision.

Override the bundle location:

```bash
DERMAFUSION_BUNDLE=/path/to/your/bundle.pt python -m demo.app
```

---

## Train from scratch (Colab recommended)

The full pipeline lives in [`notebooks/DermaFusion_Personal_Final.ipynb`](notebooks/DermaFusion_Personal_Final.ipynb). Its header documents a strict run order on a fresh kernel:

```
Phase 0.1 → 9.5 → 9.6 → 14 → 15 → 16 → 20
```

A single A100 / L4 takes **~96 min** for E0 and **~6 h** for E3.

Local CLI training (single-model B4) is also supported:

```bash
# Smoke test
python scripts/train.py training.training.epochs=2

# Full run with hair-removed images on CPU
python scripts/train.py data.data.use_preprocessed=true \
  data.data.preprocessed_image_dir=data/preprocessed_hair_removed/images \
  training.training.device=cpu
```

After training, evaluate and (optionally) export a deployment bundle:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py
python scripts/export_bundle.py \
  --checkpoint outputs/checkpoints/best.ckpt \
  --output outputs/export/dermafusion_bundle.pt \
  --mel-threshold 0.30
```

---

## Bundle validation + clinical-readiness gates

Run full-split validation against a `.pt` bundle (Colab-friendly — no Hydra config required):

```bash
python scripts/validate_app_isic2018.py \
  --bundle app/deployment_Bundle/dermafusion_ensemble.pt \
  --split val --preprocess sog --full-split \
  --out-dir outputs/validation
```

Then turn the JSON output into a pass/fail readiness report:

```bash
python scripts/clinical_readiness_report.py \
  --val-metrics  outputs/validation/validation_metrics.json \
  --test-metrics outputs/validation_test/validation_metrics.json \
  --out-dir outputs/reports --report-name clinical_readiness
```

The default `screening_v1` profile checks sample size, top-1 / balanced accuracy / macro-F1, MEL triage sensitivity / specificity / NPV, and class recall for MEL / BCC / AKIEC.

## Presentation

A 15-slide overview deck lives at [`presentation/slides.md`](presentation/slides.md). Render it with any of:

```bash
marp presentation/slides.md -o slides.pdf          # PDF
npx reveal-md presentation/slides.md               # HTML (reveal.js)
npx slidev presentation/slides.md                  # Slidev
```
